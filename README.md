# Kay Jewelers Long Island Location Analysis

## Project Overview  
This is a personal project I took on to further my understanding of mapping in Tableau. 
The goal is to create a dashboard that could give some insight as to possible locations for new Kay Jewelers stores on Long Island. 

In this project, Long Island demographic and Location data is sourced from the Stanford Data Commons, and Kay Jewelers store locations are taken from Google Maps. A RandomForestClassifier is then ran on the data to determine locations on Long Island similar to existing stores. Lastly, the data and new information is uploaded into Tableau and a map-based dashboard is created.
